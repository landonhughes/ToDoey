# ToDoey

This app is a follow-up to a previous app I made for my Intro to Mobile App Development class back in college. We were told to create an app (go figure).
Since I only was familiar with Swift using Swift Playgrounds, it was a little tricky; so at that time, I used Storyboards for the UI. For data persistence, I used Core Data.

The goal for this project is to do **everything** programmatically.

This repo will remain public in case someone stumbles upon this while browsing the interwebs looking for code samples. I will also be sure to blog about this app over on my [website](https://landonhughes.co).
