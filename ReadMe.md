# ToDoey

This app is a follow-up to a [previous app](https://github.com/landonhughes/HoldThatThought) I made for my Intro to Mobile App Development class back in college. We were told to create an app (go figure).
Since I only was familiar with Swift using Swift Playgrounds, it was a little tricky; so at that time, I used Storyboards for the UI. For data persistence, I used Core Data.

The goal for this project is to do **everything** programmatically.

This repo will remain public in case someone stumbles upon this while browsing the interwebs looking for code samples. I will also be sure to blog about this app over on my [website](https://landonhughes.co).

The main concepts I want to touch on for this project are:

- AutoLayout
- CoreData
- Resolving Git conflicts with branches
- Unit Testing



**Edit:** As of 3/10/2022, this project is __completed__ .
The main thing is that this project is functional and works.

Please feel free to clone this repo to learn about the UITableViewDiffableDataSource API and CoreData!
